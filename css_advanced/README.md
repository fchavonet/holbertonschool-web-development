## üìÑ <span id="description">Description</span>

This project is an extension of the [HTML, advanced](https://github.com/fchavonet/holbertonschool-web-development/tree/main/html_advanced) one.
In this part, I had to focus on the CSS and the style of the page. The goal was to replicate the visual style of the website shown in the screenshot below. Using the HTML code developed in the previous project, the objective was to recreate the design and styling of the site as accurately as possible with basic CSS techniques.

You can test the deployed version (via GitHub) by clicking [here](https://fchavonet.github.io/holbertonschool-web-development/css_advanced/). The site is not responsive, so for a better comparison with the reference image, I recommend testing it on a computer. On a mobile device, the experience may not be optimal, but please bear in mind that responsiveness was not the focus of this exercise.

## üéì <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

At the end of this project, I had to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google** :

- What is CSS?
- How to add style to an element.
- What is a class?
- What is a selector?
- How to compute CSS Specificity Value.
- What are Box properties in CSS?
- How does the browser load a webpage.

## üìã <span id="requirements">Requirements</span>

- All my files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- I am **not allowed** to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be build with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript (No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.).
- My code should be W3C compliant and validate with [W3C-Validator](https://validator.w3.org).

		<b>0. README and objectives!</b>

This project is following the HTML, advanced project - please make sure all tasks of this previous one are fully done.

For this project, you will focus on the CSS and the style of the page.

This designer file will be available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/fr-fr/) - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

- [Page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?node-id=0-1)
- [fig file](https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/webstack/Homepage.fig)

And ‚ÄúDuplicate to your Drafts‚Äù to have access to all design details (if not already done).

Important notes with Figma:

- If your computer doesn‚Äôt have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT).
- Some values are in float - feel free to round them.

For this task, please write an amazing `README.md` and copy the `index.html` file from `HTML, advanced`.
