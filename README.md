## 📄 <span id="description">Description</span>

All these projects were completed as part of the Holberton School curriculum. The goal was to learn the fundamentals of web development by implementing a webpage from a design file from scratch.

Below is the mockup design for the webpage:

You can compare it with the final deployed version by clicking [here](https://fchavonet.github.io/holbertonschool-web-development/css_advanced/).
<br>
The site is not responsive, so for a better comparison with the reference image, I recommend testing it on a computer.
<br>
On a mobile device, the experience may not be optimal, but please bear in mind that responsiveness was not the focus of this exercise.

I also need to do some optimization on the final CSS, but keep in mind that we only had one day for this part. I might come back to refine it later.
